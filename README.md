# Keep-In-Touch

Keep in Touch is a program that uses the Twilio API to send pulse messages to close contacts, designated in assets/contacts.vcf

This New Year's, I sent 160 messages to close friends and family. Although some responses were lost in the fold due to heavy traffic, here is some interesting data from the event:
